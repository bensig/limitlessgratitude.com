        <h1>Limitless Gratitude</h1>
        
        <p>I am a grateful human being, which makes me radiate happiness. Gratefulness makes me happy. I experience something valuable everyday by every given moment with every given experience. I didn't buy it, earn it, it is just given.</p>
        
        <p>Gratefulness and happiness spontaneously arises in my heart.</p>
        
        <p>Every moment is a new gift. Opportunity continues to present itself. We can avail or miss it. If we avail it is the key to happiness. We can rise and respond, learn even when it is painful. To Learn, to suffer, stand up.</p>
        
        <p>Method to harness for living gratefully<br>
        Stop, look, go.</p>
        
        <p>How often do people stop?<br>
        People rush through life. We miss the opportunity.</p>
        
        <p>Moment by moment, it is so simple.<br>
        We have to stop, get quiet, build stop signs into our lives. It can revolutionize our world We are in a time with a change of consciousness. Wave of gratefulness â€“ We can change our world immensely important ways.</p>
        
        <p>When we open our hearts to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us to do something!<br>
        We have the opportunity to enjoy!</p>
        
        <p>If you are grateful, you are not fearful.<br>
        If you are not fearful, you are not violent.<br>
        If you are grateful, you act out of a sense of enough, not out of sense of scarcity.<br>
        And you are willing to share.</p>
        
        <p>If you are grateful, you are enjoying the differences between people.<br>
        You are respectful to everybody.<br>
        And that change is the power pyramid in which we live.<br>
        It doesn't make for equality, but it makes for equal respect.</p>
        
        <p>Grateful world is a world of joyful people.<br>
        Grateful people are joyful people.</p>
